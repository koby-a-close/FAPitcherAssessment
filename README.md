Use spin rate to assess 2020 free agent pitchers

Using the Astros model for pitcher assessment with spin rate I assessed the 2020 free agent class.

SpinRate.py is a function that gets the relevant spin rate data for the analysis

2020FreeAgents_graphs.py gathers and plots the spin data from Statcast

2020FreeAgents_identfier.py uses filters to limit the number of pitchers to assess from 100 to 10.
